The Vanilla-Esque modpack is made to be as close to vanilla Minecraft while having small awesome stuff added in to make it feel just a little bit better!

Vanilla-Esque is made to be quite simple while keeping it fresh for your ~~short attention span~~ enjoyment. It has a combination of QOL mods, Optimization and simple cute stuff.
