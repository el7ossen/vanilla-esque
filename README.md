The Vanilla-Esque modpack is made to be as close to vanilla Minecraft while having small awesome stuff added in to make it feel just a little bit better!

Vanilla-Esque is made to be quite simple while keeping it fresh for your ~~short attention span~~ enjoyment. It has a combination of QOL mods, Optimization and simple cute stuff like [Snow! Real Magic! ⛄](https://modrinth.com/mod/snow-real-magic).

### The Future of This Modpack

- I'm hoping I can take in any suggestions and/or criticisms and put it back into the modpack
- Server modpack will be brought with the 0.2.0 update
